A microblog project I created with Miguel Grinberg's tutorial: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

This was a part of a web development course I took. The idea of this project was to get me familiar with python and flask and their way of handling registration, users, databases and emails. I used Mailtrap with emails and SQLite as my database.
